The **SkynetA11y PDF Remediation Application** brings **PDF Accessibility Remediation for WCAG & PDF/UA Compliance** directly into your own application. It is both a **PDF Accessibility Checker** and an **AI Remediation Tool**: upload documents or crawl your website for them, let AI repair the accessibility barriers automatically, review every check that was applied, and download conformant files — without leaving your own admin area.

It fixes the barriers that make PDFs unusable with assistive technology: missing tags, incorrect reading order, inaccessible forms and tables, images without alternate text, and absent document structure, language and metadata.

It supports compliance with **WCAG 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, PDF/UA, ADA, Section 508, AODA, and EN 301 549 (EAA)**. With plain-language explanations and before/after examples for every check, even non-technical users can understand what was fixed and why it mattered.

This build is **plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript** — no framework, no bundler, no build step and no dependencies — so it drops into any platform: a PHP or Node application, a CMS admin area, a static internal tool, or a page of its own.

This application is designed for:

- Businesses of all sizes
- Enterprises
- Government and public sector entities
- Website owners
- E-commerce platforms
- Development and maintenance agencies

## Why SkynetA11y PDF Remediation?

PDFs are where accessibility compliance quietly fails. A site can pass every page-level audit and still publish hundreds of untagged documents — reports, forms, invoices, policies — that screen readers cannot navigate at all.

Remediating them by hand is slow and expensive. This application makes it a routine part of publishing: documents are discovered, repaired and re-checked inside the tools your team already uses, so accessible PDFs become the default rather than a project.

## Key Features

- **SkynetA11y PDF Remediation** – Automated repair of tags, reading order, alt text, headings, tables and metadata.
- **PDF Accessibility Checker** – Every check reported individually, expandable to a plain-language explanation and a before/after example.
- **Upload or Crawl** – Add files by drag and drop, or sweep your website for every PDF it links to.
- **Free Trial** – The free plan covers your first 5 pages; paid plans scale from 50 to 10,000 pages.
- **Bulk Remediation** – Select any number of documents and process them in one run, with live progress.
- **Deep Tag Scan** – Post-remediation verification against the document's tag tree, not just its declared metadata.
- **Authenticated Downloads** – Remediated files are delivered over an authenticated session, never a public link.
- **No Settings Screen** – Nothing to paste and nothing to wire up. One short dialog asks for a name, email and domain the first time it is needed, and never again.
- **Integration with All in One Accessibility® Dashboard** – Plans, usage and billing stay in one place.

## Compliance Standards Supported

- WCAG 2.0, 2.1, 2.2
- PDF/UA (ISO 14289)
- ADA
- Section 508
- AODA
- EN 301 549 (EU / European Accessibility Act)

## How It Works

1. **Add Your PDFs** – Upload files, or crawl your website for every PDF it links to.
2. **Run AI Remediation** – Select documents and process them in bulk; progress is reported live.
3. **Review & Download** – Inspect each accessibility check with its explanation and before/after example, then download the conformant file.

### Installation

```sh
npm install sanity-plugin-skyneta11y-pdf-remediation
# or
yarn add sanity-plugin-skyneta11y-pdf-remediation
```

### Usage

Add it as a plugin in `sanity.config.ts` (or .js):

```ts
import {defineConfig} from 'sanity'
import {structureTool} from 'sanity/structure'
import {AiPdfRemediation} from 'sanity-plugin-skyneta11y-pdf-remediation'

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  plugins: [structureTool(), AiPdfRemediation()],
})
```

## CORS Policy Configuration

To avoid CORS policy issues, ensure the following URLs are allowed in your website. These URLs should be added to your CORS configuration or trusted domains list.

| **Domain** | **Description** | **Usage** |
|---|---|---|
| `https://livepdfapi.skynettechnologies.us` | SkynetA11y PDF Remediation API | Documents, remediation jobs, downloads |
| `https://ada.skynettechnologies.us` | All in One Accessibility® Dashboard | Plan upgrades via autologin |

### Instructions

1. Update your server's CORS configuration to include these URLs.
2. Ensure wildcard subdomains (`*`) are supported where necessary.
3. Verify the application functionality by testing requests to these domains.
4. If issues persist, consult the documentation for CORS configuration guidance.

If your site sends a `Content-Security-Policy`, both origins also need to be in its `connect-src`, or the browser will block the requests before they are made.
